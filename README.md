# Bank

This project is actually a test for some Russian bank. They haven't contacted me, though, but it was a good practice for me. I also realized I need a solid SQL and Kotlin (=Javascript) knowledge.

Enough with the background story. I think you are here to know what the code actually does. Basically, it is a Telegram chat bot that I built using only SQL and Python. It cannot do much and you would need to start it locally or somewhere else as it is not stored on a web server, thus it is inactive.

It has one main functions: wait for a user input as emoji (only emoji, not Telegram stickers) and reply with a phrase. There are three types of emoji this bot can recognize: happy, sad, or angry. There are not all of them because I only had to put some to test the chat bot.

And this is not all, the chat bot can recognize the change in your mood by checking the type of the next to last emoji. For that you need to type '/start' command twice, because I cannot find another way around. But as soon as you do that, you can be sure the chat bot will reply to the changes your mood if it recognizes the emoji you send.

So this is pretty much it. Some might find it easy, some might find it hard. In my opinion, it is very hard for my level (three months of Python coding with Hyperskill from JetBrains).

Thank you for reading this. If you have read the whole text, I might be the happiest person on Earth. Stay safe and good luck.
